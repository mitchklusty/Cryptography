# Cryptography

RSA
---
Contains a from-scratch Python implementation of the RSA Encryption protocol using the Miller-Rabin Primality Test
to generate keys, and an efficient modular exponentiation algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages.


AES
---
Contains a from-scratch Python implementation of 128-bit AES. Can be used to encrypt strings or files by passing the bytes of the file in.
